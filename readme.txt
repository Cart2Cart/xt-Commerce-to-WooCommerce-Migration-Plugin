== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What does the option Transfer images in product descriptions means? =
Product descriptions may contain images that are required to be moved while migrating store to another shopping cart.
If you don’t choose the option, your product will be displayed without description integrated images on your new store.
Note that you shouldn’t choose the option Strip HTML from categories and product names and description in this case as it will deny the image transfer.

= Can I be sure of data security Cart2Cart service? =
Cart2Cart performs migration using a separate Amazon EC2 server and all data is deleted after the process has been finished.
Cart2Cart does not migrate client’s credit card information and passwords.
We use secure HTTPS protocol for all connections and only authorized staff has access to the migration process.

= Can Cart2Cart migrate invoices? = 
Cart2Cart doesn’t migrate invoices, but only orders. You target shopping cart will generate invoices automatically, if this function is available. In another case, you can generate invoices manually after migration is finished.

= How Migration Insurance works? =
Migration Insurance is a service, that allows merchants to restart migration a couple of times during determined period. For your better convenience, select one of the plans provided and get an opportunity to rerun the same migration up to 3 times during up to 30 days. Comparing to Remigration service, Migration Insurance is cheaper and costs 8.5 - 12.5% of your total migration price.
f you will need to restart an insured migration, there will be an opportunity to do it in one click from your account page. The transfer will be completely the same as initial migration, including additional options selected before. In case you wish to add extra options that weren’t added during the first data migration, you will need to contact our Support Team.
Free additional option called “Clear current data from a Target Store before migration” is included to every repeated migration. This will minimize the risk of mixed or duplicated data after migration.
Please note! The additional option “Clear current data from a Target Store before migration” is irreversible, so it is highly recommended to make a backup before restarting migration.

= When can I use my discount coupon? =
You will be able to use your discount coupon on a step of full migration confirmation. Simply put a tick in an appropriate checkbox and enter the promo code.
